# Coffee-Machine-Program

This is my third python capstone project.
(part of my 100 days of python journey)

:bulb: *Main Takeaways from this Project:*

Whatever I learned in the previous days being put into use, like while loops, for loops, functions, variables, everything all packaged together. I know it was hard but i learned many new things and had fun. In last, this is what do matter.
